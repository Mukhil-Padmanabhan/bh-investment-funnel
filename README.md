#  Berkshire Investment Funnel

Berkshire Investment Funnel is a full-stack platform designed to crowdsource and evaluate investment ideas just like how seasoned investors review opportunities before making high-conviction decisions.
Users can browse, submit, and upvote investment ideas based on their potential, sector, and expected returns. Once submitted, ideas appear in a centralized dashboard for admins, who can review and either accept or reject them. If rejected, the admin can also add a reason and a lesson learned, which are shared publicly to help others understand the decision-making process.
The platform promotes transparency, collaborative judgment, and structured thinking around investing whether you're an enthusiast, a startup scout, or just love analyzing bold ideas.
